# Introduction

The prjoect is about hrms tool. The company i work for, doesn't provide me a tool
to manage my tasks efficiently and also to track my in-time, break-time and out-time.
So I decided to create a hrms tool for personal use.

# Features Of Hrms:

1. Keep track of my In Time, Out Time, Total Hours Spent.
2. Add A TODO, with task description and complexity level.
3. Keep track of to dos and a timer for each to do, which will then eventually calculate the amount of time taken
to complete that todo. (It is good to have such features in task management tools)
4. A copy icon, inorder to copy the completed tasks at the eod, and paste them in TICK.
